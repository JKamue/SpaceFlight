**Rocket model and manufacturer**

**Reason why this rocket is special**

**Link to exact stats of the rocket**
Stats like:
- Thrust
- Weight (and fuel weight)
- Burntime
- Size

**Link to images**
Real world images are great for figuring out the exact colors.
For tracing and drawing the rocket we prefer to scale drawing from the side like this one:
